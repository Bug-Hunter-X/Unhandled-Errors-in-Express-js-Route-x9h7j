# Unhandled Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Express.js applications: the lack of proper error handling within routes.  Without this, unexpected errors can cause the entire application to crash, resulting in downtime and a poor user experience.

The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js application missing crucial error handling.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling implemented.
